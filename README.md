# exam_clock

Although not the neatest code :) this small project was written after watching a 2 hour course on pluralsight on php and mySql. 
The clocks aren't actually my code, I google'd free javascript clocks and re-factored these a bit to use in my app. 
Users are able to add exam details through an editing page and assign the exam details to a display. The display can then be chosen in a particular 
room to display the exam details and clock on a TV or screen. Simple mySql tables store exam details and login username and password hash.
